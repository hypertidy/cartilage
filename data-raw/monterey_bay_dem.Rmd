## Older discussion: 

Monterey Bay in absolute coordinates X, Y, Z (metres) with Natural Earth coastline added (*+proj=lcc +lon_0=-122 +lat_0=36.45 +lat_1=36.7 +lat_2=37.2 +datum=WGS84*).

Here's the same scene using plot_3d and indexing in the NE line in matrix index space.

# notes

Working code example is in /data-raw/monterey_bay_dem.R and will download the file locally into data-raw/. 

Some challenges: 

* rayshader defaults to matrix index space
* rayshader uses `rgl.surface` with its X-Z-Y convention (affects light3d and aspect3d usage)
* plot_3d modifies the properties somehow? (I run anglr code before this to avoid)
* rayshader is t(raster) orientation 


Matrix orientation: t(raster) is different from image() as well) though this works with modifying the data further by caputuring the rayshader output with brick() to write to PNG.
